# Ricochet
 This is a top down shooter arena game where the objective is to survive against enemies and your own bullets.

For this project, I have used Unity and C#.

I am also documenting this project as I develop it, such as what features I have implemented by day and what ideas I have in mind. Just as a disclaimer, the doc is not meant to be extremely professional, and is more akin to something like a dev blog.
